# ETL
**Project Documentation Structure**

**Project Overview:** State the project's purpose, e.g., analyzing product revenue across states to uncover geographic trends and inform strategic decisions.​

**Business Requirements:** Specify business goals, desired reporting granularity (state, product type), and intended insights.​

**Data Sources:** List all relevant sources, e.g., transactional databases, sales APIs, external revenue datasets, including schema documentation, data dictionaries, and links to data catalogs.​

**ETL Pipeline Documentation:** Clearly describe each step—data extraction, cleansing, transformation (e.g., categorizing revenue by state), and loading. Include diagrams, comments in code, and details about where data is stored and processed.​

**Data Quality Assurance:** Document validation rules, checks for completeness, consistency across states, and metrics used (e.g., minimum transaction count per state).​

**Data Product Output:** Describe analytical dashboards or reports, such as visualizations of revenue by state using tools like Tableau or Power BI. Include explanation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and their business relevance.​

**Ownership, Governance & Compliance:** Assign owners for data pipelines, outline compliance measures (GDPR/HIPAA if relevant), and state service-level agreements (SLAs) for data availability and updates.​

**Maintenance and Monitoring:** Detail how updates are managed, performance monitoring procedures, and logging for audits.​

**Revision History:** Track major changes to data sources, pipeline logic, and documentation itself for transparency.

**Best Practices**
Use a consistent documentation format (Markdown or templates).​
Integrate documentation with code and data assets for context.​
Make documentation accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.​
Regularly review and update documentation after changes.​
Document only key assets in detail first, then expand iteratively.​
This structure helps ensure your data engineering project is clear, maintainable, and delivers insights on product revenue by state with stakeholder alignment at every step
